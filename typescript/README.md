# TypeScript (Browser) Code Review Challenge

### Prompt:

You are a senior engineer for Wizbang Corp. A new Jr Developer whom you havenâ€™t had a chance to meet yet has submitted her first contribution to the repository. It turns out, the success of this PR hangs the balance of a multi-billion dollar opportunity for Wizbang. As a senior engineer, you must both coach the junior developer and ensure the success of the code.

### Instructions:

Please see [the primary readme](https://github.com/airspace-link-inc/code-review-challenge) for additional steps/requirements.
After completing the code review, please invite **ddbradshaw** and **rkrupinski** as collaborators on your private repo.

The primary focus of the code review should be on the `TypeScript` code, however you may choose to offer additional comments as you play the role of Senior Engineer.

- The choice of bundler ([Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)) is irrelevant to this challenge
- It is known (and OK) that the application outputs `console.logs`
- It is known (and OK) that the application only fetches a single _people_ resource
- It is assumed that there are other mechanisms (not part of this exercise) that could potentially utilize the cache
- We are interested in feedback that would support the stability and predictability of the application

### Running the Application:

**Install**

```
$ yarn install
```

**Start**

```
$ yarn start
```
